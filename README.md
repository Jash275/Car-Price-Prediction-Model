## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of cars based on several features such as fuel type, seller type, and transmission. 

The models used in this project are:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**

Both models were evaluated on their ability to predict prices using R-squared error and scatter plots for visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `car data.csv`, containing details of various cars like:
- **Car Name**
- **Selling Price**
- **Present Price**
- **Fuel Type**
- **Seller Type**
- **Transmission**
- **Owner**

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure, missing values, and data types.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encode categorical variables (`Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, `Transmission`) using numerical values.

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Exclude the `Car_Name` and target variable `Selling_Price` from the feature set.

4. **Splitting the Data**
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets (90% training, 10% testing).

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Train Linear Regression and Lasso Regression models on the training data.
   - Evaluate models using R-squared error and scatter plot visualizations.
